Cryptographic Hash Function Characteristics    https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-hashing/


Deterministic: Always the same result.

Quick Computation: Returns has function quickly.

Pre-Image Resistance: Can't determine original input.

Small Changes:  Small changes = changes in the hash

Puzzle Friendly

For every output “Y”, if k is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy it is infeasible to find an input x such that H(k|x) = Y.
I don't understand what this is.
